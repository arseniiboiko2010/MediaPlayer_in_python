# MediaPlayer_in_python
MediaPlayer_in_python is a project that demonstrates how to use Python, vlc-python, and PyQT5 to build a media player application.

The project provides a simple media player interface with the following features:

Play, pause, stop, and seek functionality.
A playlist for loading and managing media files.
Volume control.
Fullscreen mode.
Drag-and-drop support for adding media files.
The project is implemented in the main.py file, which defines the user interface using PyQT5 widgets. It also initializes a VLC instance using vlc-python and uses it to handle media playback.

To run the project, you need to install the required dependencies:

vlc-python: pip install python-vlc
PyQT5: pip install pyqt5
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project by executing the main.py file. The media player interface should appear, and you can start playing media files by adding them to the playlist and selecting them.
